  <h1 class="text-xl mb-2 font-bold underline">Welcome to Neocities Pagoda!</h1>
  <p class="text-sm">
    <em>Pagoda</em> is a central hub for all things Neocities. It's a place
    where you engage with the community by building your own guild or
    establishing a shrine and sharing your creations with others. Guilds are a
    way to connect with other users who share similar interests, while shrines
    are public pages dedicated to a specific character, theme, or topic. You can
    also showcase your creations in the <em>Gallery</em> and participate in
    <em>Events</em>
    to earn rewards. It also features an achievement system where you can earn badges
    for completing various tasks. Guilds are able to create their own
    <em>Rooms</em>,<em>Quests</em> and <em>Events</em> for their members to
    participate in. Pagoda also features a <em>virtual</em>
    marketplace (No Real Money Trading involved) where you can acquire new assets
    for your site, such as blinkies, buttons, backgrounds, templates, and more. At
    the same time, artists can sell their creations to other users. The possibilities
    are endless!!!
